# PointyStone3

Pointy Stone 3 is an Othello playing program for Windows (64-bit or 32-bit)

It's pretty strong, but extremely old, so won't be competetive with newer programs.
I was still surprised at how good it is at solving endgames.

I'm putting up the source code in case anyone is curious to look at a strong othello program or use it for experimenting. (Also having more of my old code on github is convient for me.)
